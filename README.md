# LtShowcase

This is a solution for LT Technical showcase.

It is a console application in C#. Please build the code in Visual Studio.

When the console application is running, type in correct command, ex. `photo-album 2`, will display all the photo ids and titles in the album.
If the command is not correct, the console will return `Command is not valid.`
`quit` is a special command. The console will close immediately after `quit` coomand.

All the commands are not case sensitive.
